# Fast_food_nutrition_EDA

This project is to analyze the fast food served across 8 fast food restaurants, and gain insights on the relationships between different variables. I implemented python to perform data cleaning by removing duplicated rows and imputing null values. Meanwhile, aggregated and visualized the data by using pandas and seaborn to highlight the insights.
